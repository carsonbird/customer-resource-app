Amway typically releases many new products each year. If you follow their weekly announcement emails, you'll know upcoming product launch dates months or weeks ahead of time. This is a great opportunity to reengage customers that have stopped ordering, and to find new customers who will benefit from the new products.

Hey David! Hope your day is going great! I wanted to let you know that in about a week, we're releasing a brand new superfood smoothie on our online store and with some of the nutrition goals you've told me you're working towards, I thought you might want to try it. If you'd like, I can deliver it to you when it arrives. It's $34 for 30 servings, and here's the link if you want to check it out yourself: [include your https://amwy.me shareable link to the product]
