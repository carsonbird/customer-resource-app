It's a good idea to have a central calendar which keeps track of significant events in the lives of your customers and sphere of influence. That way, you can reach out and keep in touch with people at times that make sense, and, you can serve them based on these events.

Here are some examples of events you'll want to keep track of:
- Birthdays
- Weddings
- Anniversaries
- Graduations
- Holidays
- Home Moves or Purchases
- Job Changes
- Births
- Health Challenges

You can use something simple like a <resource-chip path="resources/customer-profiles">Customer Profile</resource-chip> binder, a physical calendar, or something digital like a Google Calendar or Project Management software. The important thing is that you can view an upcoming month's events at the end of the current month so you can plan gifts and purchase relevant items in your <resource-chip path="resources/ditto">DITTO</resource-chip>.
