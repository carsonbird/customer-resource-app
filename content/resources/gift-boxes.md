These are gift boxes. Gift boxes are best for most gifts and purchases. It's the most unique and memorable experience you can offer.

You'll want to establish a consistent <resource-chip path="resources/branding">Brand</resource-chip> for these gift boxes that delights customers and gives them something to look forward to each time they receive one. You'll also want to theme the gift boxes appropriately if there is an <resource-chip path="resources/events-calendar">Occasion</resource-chip> or <resource-chip path="resources/holidays">Holiday</resource-chip>.

Always make sure to include a personal touch, like a note, and some kind of sample.

Gift boxes can be used for gifts, AND for delivering product purchases.
