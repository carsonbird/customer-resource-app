Business cards are an optional tool, but one which can be utilized effectively in certain situations. Be aware, they can be damaging when used in the wrong situations.

We recommend refraining from spamming people with your business card. The purpose of a business card is not to introduce people to your business, but to allow prospective customers to keep in touch with you, and have access to your store AFTER you've already made a connection with them, and established that they're interested in being served by you.

You'll want to establish a <resource-chip path="resources/branding">Personal Brand Identity</resource-chip> prior to creating these, so all your materials will keep to a consistent theme.

Here are a few items you should consider including on a business card:

- Your name(s)
- Your photo
- Your contact info (phone & email)
- 5 product Categories
- A <resource-chip path="resources/qr-codes">QR Code</resource-chip> that links to your store
- The URL of your store (or a shortened link to it)
- A tasteful, classy design

You can use a Link Shortener service like [Bitly](https://bitly.com/) to shorten your store URL. You can also purchase a domain name that forwards to your store, but this is entirely optional.

Make sure the QR code generator service you use allows you to change the destination of your QR code even after it's printed. That way, if you ever want to redirect customers to a different site, but you've already printed your QR codes, you won't have to reprint them.
