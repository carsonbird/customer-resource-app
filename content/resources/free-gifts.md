In this business, the way to set yourself apart from the rest of the world in the eyes of the customer is to follow the Stratospheric Laws of Success laid out in the book, "The Go Giver". The main principle is to always give more value than you receive, and to scale that service to as many people as possible.

Free gifts are one way to do that. We know the products we provide are the best of the best, and so for this business, getting free gifts into the hands of customers is a viable and sustainable model. Typically, if the right service provides the right customer with the right product, that customer will become a customer for life. The value you receive from a loyal customer will offset the cost of the free gift.
