These are gift bags. Gift bags are best for only the most casual types of gifting, like birthday parties or white elephants.

You'll want to establish a consistent <resource-chip path="resources/branding">Brand</resource-chip> for these gift bags that delights customers and gives them something to look forward to each time they receive one. You'll also want to theme the gift bags appropriately if there is an <resource-chip path="resources/events-calendar">Occasion</resource-chip> or <resource-chip path="resources/holidays">Holiday</resource-chip>.

Always make sure to include a personal touch, like a note, and some kind of sample.

Gift bags can be used for gifts, AND for delivering product purchases.
