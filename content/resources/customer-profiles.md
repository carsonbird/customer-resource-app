Build a profile around each of your customers. Use it to keep track of events in their lives, likes, dislikes, product preferences, dietary restrictions, etc. This will allow you to serve more people at a higher standard, as your service will be consistent, and you won't have to keep track of everything in your head.

WWG's Customer Profile is an excellent example. Feel free to use theirs, or adapt it into one of your own. If you'd like, you can use a CRM or Project Management software to keep a digital version that's available wherever you need it.
