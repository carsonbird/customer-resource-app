Catalogs are a great resource! Amway releases new catalogs every year that showcase new products and old favorites. You can customize and mark up the catalog with recommendations for specific customers, then deliver those catalogs to the customer for them to review.

Inside the catalogs, customers can see pictures of products, prices, benefits, solutions, and more.

The catalogs exist in both physical magazine AND online format. The digital version includes videos and links directly to the product pages.
