A unique way to serve customers. As a business owner, you don't have to serve customers directly. With access to exclusive products and a knack for meeting people's needs, you can offer your services to people who are in needs of gifts but don't have the time, expertise, or connections to do what you can do.

For example, you can reach out to husbands during early February and offer to put together a customized Valentine's Day gift box for their wives, based on the wife's needs and their family's budget. You'll take care of everything and have it delivered on time, no problem.

You could even go so far as to assemble a catalog of example gift sets that people can purchase from you on demand.

You can also offer these services to <resource-chip path="resources/b2b-sales">Businesses</resource-chip> to help with employee and customer appreciation.
