Some customers may prefer email communication. It's not super often, so you probably shouldn't spend much time on this. But, emails can be used to let customers know about <resource-chip path="resources/product-launches">New Products</resource-chip>, <resource-chip path="resources/self-backed-deals">Deals</resource-chip>, and more. 

You'll want to keep these emails styled in line with your established <resource-chip path="resources/branding">Brand Identity</resource-chip>.
