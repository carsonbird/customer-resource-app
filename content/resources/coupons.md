Coupons are a unique resource that some customers may love to take advantage of.

Amway doesn't usually run <resource-chip path="resources/amway-discounts-promotions">Discounts or Promotions</resource-chip> on their items, as they are already priced competitively. However, in certain situations, you can use your own custom coupons to add value to customers and encourage them to be loyal to you.

For example, when you deliver a gift or an order, you can include a "10% off any supplement" coupon or a "buy one gummy, get one free". If you know a customer is interested in certain skincare items, but hasn't made the jump to try them yet, you can help them by issuing a coupon for that item.

You can use the "Create a Receipt" tool

I'm not convinced this is really an effective method. If a customer wants to try something, you should just give them a sample or a free one. If they like it, they'll get more. It's an investment.

But, I guess this could be effective for incentivizing customers to buy again from you in the future. Actually, in that case, it's probably SUPER effective.

You'll want to establish a consistent <resource-chip path="resources/branding">Personal Brand</resource-chip> prior to creating these. That branding will help inform you what kind of a look and feel those coupons should have.
