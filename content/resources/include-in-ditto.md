title: Including Orders in DITTO

You already get products for yourself through DITTO each month. Since Amway charges for shipping, it's a great idea to reach out to your active and potential customers near the end of each month, or whenever you're already ordering products anyways, and ask them if there's anything you can include in your order for them. Make it clear that they can buy it from you, but that you'll cover the shipping costs and hand deliver it to them as soon as the order arrives. Let them know there's no pressure. In my experience, customers aren't annoyed by your consistently checking in with them, but actually appreciate it. If a customer lives at a distance, you can simply ship the items directly to them, and cover the shipping costs yourself.

Here's an example conversation or text you can have:

<blockquote class="blockquote">

Hey! Hope your day is going great! I wanted to let you know that I am putting an order into my store for myself here in a few days. Is there anything you'd like me to include for you? Let me know what you'd like, and I can pay for shipping and bring it to you as soon as it arrives. If you're all good for now, no worries!
