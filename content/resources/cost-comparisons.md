When it comes to pricing, Amway products seem to come in 2 varieties:

1. Items priced lower than anywhere else, to save customers' money (some of our cleaning supplies)
2. Items priced higher than what you'd see at Walmart or Target (because they are higher-quality than what those stores sell), but which are higher quality and lower priced than comparable high-end competitors.

You can use the cost comparison app I've built to find items that will save customers' money.

You can search for products they already use, and show them how they will save money AND get additional benefits by using your products.
