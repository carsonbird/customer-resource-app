These are gift baskets. Gift baskets are best for delivering 
larger quantities of items, and for festive holidays like Christmas and Valentine's Day.

You'll want to establish a consistent <resource-chip path="resources/branding">Brand</resource-chip> for these gift baskets that delights customers and gives them something to look forward to each time they receive one. You'll also want to theme the gift baskets appropriately if there is an <resource-chip path="resources/events-calendar">Occasion</resource-chip> or <resource-chip path="resources/holidays">Holiday</resource-chip>.

Always make sure to include a personal touch, like a note, and some kind of sample.

Gift baskets can be used for gifts, AND for delivering product purchases.
