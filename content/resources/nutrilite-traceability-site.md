Nutrilite is the only supplement company to own the whole manufacturing process, from the soil, to the seed, to the end product. They keep extensive records of their sourcing, methods, and testing for each of their products.

Because of this, Nutrilite has built a website that allows customers to trace the history and route of the supplements they are currently using. Check it out. It's fun and professionally developed.

It's a great resource for those interested in the Nutrilite brand, and for those who value sustainable business practices and transparency.
