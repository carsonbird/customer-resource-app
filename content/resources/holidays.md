Holidays are a great time to get back in touch with friends and family, and spend some time learning about their needs.

As a business owner, it's also a great time to put your products in the hands of potential customers. If you owned a business that sold watches, you'd give watches as gifts to those who needed them. Likewise, you can give gifts from your store to those who would benefit from it.

Keep track of upcoming holidays with your <resource-chip path="resources/events-calendar">Events Calendar</resource-chip> and plan your actions accordingly. Send <resource-chip path="resources/holiday-cards">Holiday Cards</resource-chip> and <resource-chip path="resources/holiday-videos">Videos</resource-chip>. Put together some <resource-chip path="resources/gift-boxes">Gift Boxes</resource-chip>, <resource-chip path="resources/gift-baskets">Baskets</resource-chip>, and <resource-chip path="resources/gift-bags">Bags</resource-chip>. Use <resource-chip path="resources/mailers">Mailers</resource-chip> for those at a distance.

Invite your sphere of influence and your existing customers to use your <resource-chip path="resources/gifts-as-a-service">Services</resource-chip> in finding gifts for others.

Be careful to guard your mindset as you spend time with family, especially if they are not supportive of your dreams.
