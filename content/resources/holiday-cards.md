Holiday cards are a great way to stay in touch with your Sphere of Influence, and as a way to give an extra thank you to loyal existing customers.

For your sphere of influence, you may create a themed card that includes a request to stay in touch.

For your customers, you may include a generous thank you for supporting you in your business this year. Make sure to invite them to let you know how you can support them in the coming year.

Additionally, you can create a <resource-chip path="resources/holiday-videos">Holiday Video</resource-chip> that accomplishes the same thing.
