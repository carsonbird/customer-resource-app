Holiday cards are a great way to stay in touch with your Sphere of Influence, and as a way to give an extra thank you to loyal existing customers.

For your sphere of influence, you may create a themed card that includes a request to stay in touch.

For your customers, you may include a generous thank you for supporting you in your business this year. Make sure to invite them to let you know how you can support them in the coming year.
