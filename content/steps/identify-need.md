When you're meeting people, keep your eyes & ears alert for needs they have. If you're familiar with the problems your products solve, through your own <resource-chip path="preparations/personal-use">Personal Use</resource-chip>, through <resource-chip path="preparations/amway-education">Amway Education</resource-chip>, and through the <resource-chip path="preparations/solution-matrix">Product Solution Matrix</resource-chip> linked below, you will begin to identify ways to serve those in need.

Familiarize yourself with the Solution Matrix if you haven't already.
