With good friends and family, it's ok to simply ask them if they're willing to support you in your dream. If a close friend or family member opened a barber shop, all their friends and family would likely go there for a haircut, even if the prices were a little higher.

This business is no different. Family members should support one anothers' dreams within the confines of healthy boundaries. If a family member has a dream of becoming an olympic athlete, those dreams should be supported. If a family member has a dream of being financially independent as a full-time spouse and parent, that dream should be supported. Family members who truly have your best interest in mind will see value in supporting your store, transitioning their spending away from competitor stores.

However, it's often not this simple. Family members and friends haven't seen what you've seen and don't know who you know. Be kind if family and friends don't understand. Often, it takes years for them to come around. But, through your hard work and dedication, detractors will switch sides and become supporters instead. This is the natural way of the common spectator.

Include some verbiage about this as well. For example:

<blockquote class="blockquote">Hey family/friend, I have recently opened an online store, as one of many strategies to build financial freedom for my family and to get home with my spouse and kids full-time. I would love to earn your support in this endeavor. We source great products that you probably already use, and I can connect you with higher-quality products for competitive prices, satisfaction guaranteed. Will you give me a chance to earn your support?</blockquote>
