Give gifts that match whatever <resource-chip path="steps/significant-events">Events</resource-chip> are taking place. These could be <resource-chip path="resources/events-calendar">Birthdays, Weddings, Graduations, etc</resource-chip>, and <resource-chip path="resources/holidays">Holidays</resource-chip>.

You can use <resource-chip path="resources/gift-baskets">Gift Baskets</resource-chip>, <resource-chip path="resources/gift-bags">Gift Bags</resource-chip>, <resource-chip path="resources/gift-boxes">Gift Boxes</resource-chip>, or <resource-chip path="resources/mailers">Mailers</resource-chip> for those at a distance.

You can easily know which gifts to buy for the upcoming month based on pre-set <resource-chip path="resources/gift-bundles">Gift Bundles</resource-chip>.
