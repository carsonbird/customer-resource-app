Try the following verbiage:

<blockquote class="blockquote">

"If I can show you how to get a better product for a better price with a 6-month guarantee, no questions asked, and it supports me, will you give me a chance to earn your business?"

</blockquote>

Alternatively, you could use the following:

<blockquote class="blockquote">

"I have an online shop and would love to earn your business and incentivize you as my customer. If I can show you products youâ€™re already buying but with a better value, top quality, and great service from me, would you consider supporting me?

"The products include a 180-day satisfaction guarantee and include items for your health, immune health, cleaning, personal care, laundry, beauty, etc.

"If I left you some samples or catalogs, would you take a look and give me the chance to earn your business?"
