If the individual you're looking to serve is open to supporting you, exchange contact info with them.

It's a good idea to exchange phone numbers, as that way, you can keep in touch over text AND phone, opening up opportunities to serve customers the way they want to be served. Here's an example of some great verbiage you can use:

<blockquote class="blockquote">

...Sounds great! I'll send you a text with my name and number so we can keep in touch. Where should I send it?

</blockquote>

Then, wait for them to give you their phone number. This way, the exchanging of contact info feels very natural, and you won't have to rely on the individual remembering later on to text you their number. You can use this as a soft test of trust as well. If the individual isn't comfortable exchanging phone numbers, then they're not really interested in your offer. There's no need to push; you can exit the conversation gracefully and wish them a happy day.

Some customers would rather exchange contact info through social media. There's nothing necessarily bad about this, but you'll want to be sure to take conversations off of social media, to protect yourself legally.
