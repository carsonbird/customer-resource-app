If the individual you're looking to serve is open to supporting you, exchange contact info with them. You'll want to store this contact info in their <resource-chip path="resources/customer-profiles">Customer Profile</resource-chip>.

It's a good idea to exchange phone numbers, as that way, you can keep in touch over text AND phone, opening up opportunities to serve customers the way they want to be served. Here's an example of some great verbiage you can use:

<blockquote class="blockquote">

...Sounds great! I'll send you a text with my name and number so we can keep in touch. Where should I send it?

</blockquote>

Then, wait for them to give you their phone number. This way, the exchanging of contact info feels very natural, and you won't have to rely on the individual remembering later on to text you their number. You can use this as a soft test of trust as well. If the individual isn't comfortable exchanging phone numbers, then they're not really interested in your offer. There's no need to push; you can exit the conversation gracefully and wish them a happy day.

Some customers would rather exchange contact info through <resource-chip path="resources/social-media">Social Media</resource-chip>. There's nothing necessarily bad about this, but you'll want to be sure to take conversations off of social media, to protect yourself legally.

Different customers may prefer different forms of contact. You can use <resource-chip path="resources/phonecalls">Phonecalls</resource-chip>, <resource-chip path="resources/texts">Texts</resource-chip>, <resource-chip path="resources/emails">Emails</resource-chip>, and <resource-chip path="resources/social-media">Social Media</resource-chip>. Phonecalls or in-person communication is definitely preferred, as that's the easiest way to convey emotion, and serve with your unique personality. Remember the Law of Authenticity from "The Go Giver": *"The most valuable gift you have to offer is yourself."*
