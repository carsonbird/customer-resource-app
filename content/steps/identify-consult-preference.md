Find out how they want to be served:

1. Personal Consultation - a sit down or virtual meeting. The most hands on, the most valuable, because you can be there with them and bring your expertise and positivity.
2. Quick Questions - quick and easy. The same questions you'll ask in a personal consult, but you can run through them then and there.
3. Customer Survey - easy and quick for customers to fill out, and they don't have to do it right then. Great if they're not comfortable sitting down with you right away.
4. Catalog + Guessed Samples - sharing a catalog with them, and including samples you assume they'll enjoy, based on what you know about them.
5. Gift Baskets / Guess Samples - delivering a gift basket with random samples. Basically a shotgun-shot in the dark, as a last result.
