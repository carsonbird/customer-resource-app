This is a great way to connect with people, and empathize with their frustrations and needs. The Feel-Felt-Found framework follows this pattern:

<blockquote class="blockquote">

"I know how you feel. I felt the same way. Thankfully, I found [a product] and now I [don't anymore].

</blockquote>

Here's an example from WWG:

<blockquote class="blockquote">

"I have no energy."

"I know how you feel. I felt the same way, but I found XSâ„¢
energy drinks and now I have more energy."

</blockquote>

The aware individual will likely respond with, "Really? Wow! Where'd you get that? I'd like to try some!", to which you can reply "I totally understand. I (or my spouse and I) actually get them from our own online store."
