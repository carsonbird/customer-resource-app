"Be a product of the product" &mdash;Joya Baker

</blockquote>

Being CORE, with 100% Personal Use, will give you the confidence you need to share the products. You shouldn't promote or recommend something you're not doing yourself, and you'll be most experienced with the products if you're using them daily.

It's a good idea to display products in your home. For example, leave your gummies out where people can see them.

It's also a good idea to always have extra products with you at all times - samples, drinks, extra bars, etc. That way, you'll always be able to share products with people and see if they like them. Be generous; budget in items you plan on giving away so that you can do so without worrying about, or compromising your finances and your business blueprint.

Whenever possible, share your products. For example, bring your own supplies to parties, luncheons, etc. Birthday gifts should be primarily from your store. Helping somebody clean? Bring your own cleaning supplies.

Don't be pushy. Share your experiences with your products only if people are curious.
