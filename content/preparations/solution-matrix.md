Familiarize yourself with the Product Solution Matrix. It's a tool that allows you to search for products based on needs people have, and what price range they're looking at. For example, let's say you overhear one of your friends explaining how they overstretched a tendon while exercising. Searching for "injured tendons" on the product solution matrix, you would find our collagen and joint health supplements in all their various forms, sorted by effectiveness and cost. As you have a conversation with your friend, you can present these solutions to them and see what they'd like to do.
